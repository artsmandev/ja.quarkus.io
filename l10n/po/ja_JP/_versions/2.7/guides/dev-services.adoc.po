"Quarkus supports the automatic provisioning of unconfigured services in development and test mode. We refer to this capability\n"
"as Dev Services. From a developer's perspective this means that if you include an extension and don't configure it then\n"
"Quarkus will automatically start the relevant service (usually using https://www.testcontainers.org/[Testcontainers] behind the scenes) and wire up your\n"
"application to use this service."
