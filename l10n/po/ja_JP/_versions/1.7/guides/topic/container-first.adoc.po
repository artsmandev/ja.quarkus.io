During the built-time processing, extensions can analyze the application code and the classes available on the classpath and replace reflection calls with regular invocations.  The usage of dynamic proxies is also prevented by using generating custom proxy at build time."

Runtime capabilities such as health checks and metrics are exposed out of the box.  {project-name} collects all the required metadata at build time to create the Kubernetes deployment descriptor and produce a container image.  A single command line can deploy your application onto your Kubernetes cluster."
