"Green threads were user-level threads scheduled by the Java virtual machine (JVM) instead of natively by the underlying operating system (OS).\n"
"They emulated multithreaded environments without relying on native OS abilities.\n"
"They were managed in user space instead of kernel space, enabling them to work in environments that do not have native thread support.\n"

"The whole processing runs on this thread, and the thread cannot be reused until the processing completes (so the response is sent back).\n"
"When the processing executes a blocking I/O operation, like calling another service, writing to the file system, or interacting with a database, the thread is blocked, waiting for the response.\n"

"So, instead of having a large pool of threads, you have a minimum number of threads (generally equal to the number of CPU cores).\n"

"When a request is received, it calls the processing code on one of these threads.\n"

"However, since the JVM manages virtual threads, no underlying OS thread is blocked when they perform this blocking operation.\n"
"The state of the virtual thread is stored in the heap, and another virtual thread can be executed on the same Java platform (carrier) thread, exactly as in the reactive model.\n"
"When the I/O operation completes, the virtual thread becomes executable again, and when a carrier thread is available, the state of the virtual thread is restored, and the execution continues.\n"
