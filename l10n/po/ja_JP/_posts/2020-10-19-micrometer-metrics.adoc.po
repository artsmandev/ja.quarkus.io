"The design and development of Micrometer focused on the needs of SREs from the very beginning.\n"
"A key aspect to that approach is separating out the metric implementation into the registries,\n"

"aligning with a specific monitoring tool."

"Micrometer does follow different naming conventions than Dropwizard or MP Metrics, for a few reasons.\n"
"First, it uses a dot notation for all metric names, e.g. my.metric.name.\n"
"Each registry implementation can then apply its own naming convention to convert that name into something that matches its convention.\n"
"The Prometheus MeterRegistry converts my.metric.name into my_metric_name, for example.\n"
"Second, Micrometer was built around the notion of dimensional metrics, rather than adapting to it later."

"Another benefit to using Micrometer is its usage in the wider Java ecosystem.\n"

"In an environment where SREs are monitoring instances of different Java frameworks,\n"
