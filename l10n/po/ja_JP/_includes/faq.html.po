msgid "Think of Quarkus extensions as your project dependencies. Extensions configure, boot and integrate a framework or technology into your Quarkus application. They also do all of the heavy lifting of providing the right information to GraalVM for your application to compile natively. This will allow 3rd party projects to easily take advantage of the work we have done to make it easier to target GraalVM."

Just hop on our <a href=\"https://quarkus.io/community/#discussions\">mailing list</a> to discuss your ideas and get help.

These native executables start much faster and can use a lot less memory than a traditional JVM, however not every JVM feature is supported, and some are more limited than normal."

msgid "For example by default reflection in GraalVM will not work, unless a class/member has been explicitly registered for reflection. This is normally achieved by listing every class, method, field and constructor in a JSON file, and passing this as a parameter into the native image build. This obviously gets quite cumbersome for all but the most trivial projects. Quarkus provides a framework that makes it easy to work around these annotations, and programmatically determine what should be registered."
